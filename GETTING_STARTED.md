# Getting Started with CivicTechWR Project Template

Welcome to the CivicTechWR Project Template! This guide will help you navigate the template and get your civic tech project up and running quickly.

## ⚡ TL;DR: Launch in 30 Minutes

1. Verify prerequisites with `./scripts/setup.sh --check` (Git, Node, gh scopes).
2. Run `./scripts/setup.sh` to install dependencies and drop starter files.
3. Kick off a GitHub Project via `CTWR_PROJECT_OWNER=CivicTechWR ./scripts/setup-project.sh` (we recommend creating your repo inside the [CivicTechWR org](https://github.com/CivicTechWR)).
4. Apply baseline security settings using `./scripts/setup-security.sh`.
5. In **Settings → Pages**, select **GitHub Actions** so docs deploy automatically; if you host outside the CivicTechWR org, ensure the repo is public or on a plan that supports private Pages.
6. Customize `README.md` and the wiki starter pages (the setup script prints a post-flight checklist to guide you).

### Using GitHub Issues

Create issues using the provided templates:

```bash
# Or use GitHub CLI
gh issue create --template feature_request
gh issue create --template user_research
gh issue create --template community_partnership
```

### Wiki Setup

Use the wiki templates to document your project:

1. Copy files from `wiki-template/` to your GitHub Wiki
2. Customize with your project details
3. Keep team information updated

### GitHub Pages Setup

### "My project doesn't need all this documentation"

Start with the essentials:

- Project Pitch (required for CTWR)
- Technical Design (if building software)
- Security Guide (if handling user data)
- GitHub Pages setup (if you need a public website)

### "How do I know if my project is civic tech?"

Civic tech projects:

- **Serve the public interest** - Address community problems
- **Engage community members** - Include affected people in the process
- **Build public capacity** - Make civic processes more accessible
- **Create public value** - Benefits extend beyond individual users

### "What if I'm not technical?"

- **Start with user research** - Technical solutions come after understanding problems
- **Partner with developers** - Use the Contributing guide to recruit technical help
- **Focus on design and process** - Many civic tech projects need more design than code
- **Use low-code tools** - Sometimes the best solution is a well-designed form or workflow
