> **🚀 New to this template?** Start with the **[Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** for a 5-minute overview and step-by-step instructions.

## Quick Summary

**Prerequisites (10 minutes):**

- Git 2.30+ (`git --version`)
- Node.js 18+ with npm (`node --version`, `npm --version`)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated with:
  - `gh auth login`
  - `gh auth refresh -s project --hostname github.com` (for project automation)
  - `gh auth status` showing `project` and `repo` scopes
- Optional: Python 3.10+, Ruby/Bundler, or Flutter if your project uses them

> Tip: Run `./scripts/setup.sh --check` (new flag) for a prereq-only diagnostic before installing dependencies.

This template provides everything needed for a successful CivicTechWR project: 12-week project lifecycle, comprehensive documentation, GitHub automation, security best practices, and public website hosting.

**Essential first steps:**

1. **[Complete the Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - Your roadmap to success
2. **Fill out your Project Pitch** - Define your civic impact
3. **Set up your development environment** - Automated scripts included

> **For detailed guidance:** Read the **[Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - it breaks down the entire process with week-by-week instructions, common questions, and success metrics.

## Problem Statement

**What is the problem?**
[Describe the specific community problem you're addressing]

**Who is affected?**
[Name the people or groups and where they are, e.g., "seniors in Kitchener who rely on buses after 9pm"]

**What exists today?**
[How are users solving or mitigating the problem today? Tools, programs, workarounds, policies, past attempts and their gaps]

**Why now?**
[What's changed or urgent about the problem? Any time-bound opportunity or risk?]

## Solution Overview

[Brief description of what you're building and how it addresses the problem]

## Team

| Name | Role | Skills | Weekly Commitment |
|------|------|--------|------------------|
| [Name] | [Role] | [Skills] | [Hours/week] |

**What help do we need from the community?**
[Data, introductions, volunteers with certain skills, user interviews, etc.]

**What are we bringing to CTWR?**
[Time, domain knowledge, user access, data, story, test space, feedback cadence, or sponsorship]

## Technical Approach

**Technology Stack:**

- Frontend: [e.g., React, Jekyll, Flutter]
- Backend: [e.g., Python/Django, Node.js, Ruby]
- Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite]
- Deployment: [e.g., GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify]

**Architecture Decisions:**
[Brief rationale for tech choices - see [TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md](docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md) for details]

## Community Impact

**Success Metrics:**
[Simple outcomes or signals - e.g., fewer missed appointments, faster sign-ups, clearer info]

**How this strengthens Waterloo Region's civic fabric:**
[Connection to broader civic goals and community benefits]

## Project Timeline

- **Week 1-3**: Problem validation and user research
- **Week 4-6**: User research and prototype development
- **Week 7-9**: Core feature development
- **Week 10-11**: Testing and refinement
- **Week 12**: Demo Day presentation

## Setup Summary

**📖 [Complete Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - Full walkthrough recommended

**Quick commands after reading the guide:**

### Quick Setup Commands

```bash
# 0. Pre-flight check (optional but recommended)
./scripts/setup.sh --check

# 1. Bootstrap local environment
./scripts/setup.sh

# 2. Provision GitHub Project for project tracking
CTWR_PROJECT_OWNER=CivicTechWR ./scripts/setup-project.sh  # recommend hosting in the CivicTechWR org

# 3. Apply security baseline (branch protection, Dependabot, secret scanning)
./scripts/setup-security.sh
```

> ⚠️ `./scripts/setup-project.sh` needs `gh` with the `project` scope and permissions **inside the CivicTechWR organization** (recommended home for new repos). Run `gh auth refresh -s project --hostname github.com` first.
>
> ⚠️ `./scripts/setup-security.sh` needs `gh` with `repo` scope plus admin rights. Verify with `gh auth status` and ensure you can edit repository settings.
>
> 📢 **GitHub Pages:** Repos under `github.com/CivicTechWR` can stay private if the org plan allows private Pages. For personal forks, make the repo public or upgrade so the docs site can publish.

**Post-flight checklist:**

- Enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → GitHub Actions)
- Run the project (`./scripts/setup-project.sh`) and security (`./scripts/setup-security.sh`) automation
- Update README, wiki, and CODEOWNERS with real details
- Invite partners/volunteers to the repo and GitHub Project
